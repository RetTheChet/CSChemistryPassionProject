I’ve decided to make a program that blends both my chemistry and computer science interests. Now… the END GOAL is to create an interactive orbital (accounting Heisenberg law) compound creation viewer, but that’s called the end goal for a reason. Let’s start off with something simple, a program that has the data of the first 20 elements in the periodic table, the program asks the user which elements react, the program follows the rules of bonding (figuring out if it covalent or ionic) and spits out the final result of the reaction (Ex: “What is the first element: H” “What is the second element: O” “Final Result: H2O”).
